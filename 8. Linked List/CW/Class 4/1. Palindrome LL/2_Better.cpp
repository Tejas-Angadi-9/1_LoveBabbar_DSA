//! Use the same approach of using 2 pointers in array but in LL we can't use 2 pointer approach as the address is not contiguous. So we will create a new array & iterate the LL, insert the values of LL into the array and then apply 2 pointer approach to check if is palindrome or not

// ! TC: O(n)       SC: O(n)    -> Try not to use the extra space
